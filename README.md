# Heart

A small page: a line with “click me” in the middle that morphs into a wavy heart.

## Dev

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (e.g. http://localhost:5173).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is in `dist/`. For GitHub Pages you can deploy the contents of `dist/` (e.g. from the `main` branch or the `gh-pages` branch).

## GitHub repo

If the remote is not set to your repo yet:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/heart.git
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.
